We could implement this by using multiple rio images like image of the White and Blue cars, image of the grass, Brown Building, Yellow Signs. Then we will use Histogram Back Propagation and select the part which match the Histogram of the Video frame by frame and remove these part and using noise cancellation we would remove the unnecessary parts. Then we cud put bounding boxes around the different patches which will be the people. If the patch is too small then we could remove that as people can't be smaller and the people who are far away won't be an issue for self driving automobiles.
